;; This file contains (a first guess of) the activities and their durations per age class
;; (first guess of the) cycles per age-class:
;;   - 5-14   school -> recreation (afternoon) -> home
;;   - 15-19   school -> recreation (afternoon) | home -> home
;;   - 20-24   school -> home -> recreation (evening) -> home
;;   - 25-39   work -> home -> recreation (evening) | home -> home
;;   - 40-64   work -> home -> recreation (evening) | home -> home
;;   - >=65   recreation -> home -> recreation -> home
;; Any kind of cycle can be defined by specifying the couples activity - duration in 
;; order, as done below
;; Specifiable activities are:
;;   - "school" (must be specified only for the appropriate age class)
;;   - "work" (must be specified only for the appropriate age class)
;;   - "recreation" (the exact activity will be chosen randomly)
;;   - "home"
;; However, if one wishes to introduce variability for a time slice, an activity like
;; "activityA-activityB" can be specified -> this will make so that for that time slice
;; the activity will be randomly chosen between the two (the duration will remain the same)
;; Note that one can specify any number of activities separated by the hyphen for a single 
;; time slice -> as a side effect, this is also useful to make so that an activity will be 
;; chosen more likely -> for example by specifying "school-recreation" the likeliness of 
;; each activity will be 50%, but with "school-school-school-recreation", "school" will be 
;; chosen 75% of the times, "recreation" 25% of the times
