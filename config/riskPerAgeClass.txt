;; This file contains the risk (probability) of contracting the virus per age class and 
;; situation
;; see http://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato1389403.pdf (Riaperture_report.pdf)
;; In each age class we only have the risks related to situations we modelled
;; In particular, for each age class we have the risks (in the presented order):
;; 0-4 -> home-risk
;; 5-14 -> home-risk, school-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; 15-19 -> home-risk, school-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; 20-24 -> home-risk, school-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; 25-39 -> home-risk, work-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; 40-64 -> home-risk, work-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; >=65 -> home-risk, transports-risk, leisure-risk
;; Since the document has more age classes than we consider, when we aggregate some, the
;; value considered is the mean of the single values
;; Each probability is obtained as the (mean) number of contacts in a certain 
;; situation divided by the total (mean) number of contacts the age class experiences 
;; (minus the "Altre attivitÃ " number of contacts, since those activities aren't 
;; modelled) * 100

;; risk 0-4 (total number of contacts = 13.79)
32.56
;; risk 5-14   (total number of contacts = 21.35)
21.17   48.85   5.81   23.79
;; risk 15-19   (total number of contacts = 26.41)
17.38   50.06   6.59   25.86
;; risk 20-24   (total number of contacts = 17.35)
20.23   6.74   5.53   41.67   ;; school-risk basso (forse non si considera l'uni nel doc)
;; risk 25-39   (total number of contacts = 16.82)
22.59   33.53   5.83   30.62
;; risk 40-64   (total number of contacts = 16.42)
19.24   41.35   4.38   19.00
;; risk >=65   (total number of contacts = 8.60)
