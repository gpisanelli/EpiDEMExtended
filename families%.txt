;; This file contains (a first estimate) of the percentages related to some possible
;; family structures. Its aim is to make the disposition of the people into families
;; customizable
;; Families are created depending on some rules:
;;   - normally at most 4 people per family -> though it may happen that for a person 
;;     there aren't enough other people (of a proper age-class) to form a family with ->
;;     -> in those cases, that person is assigned to an already existing family
;;   - at most two children per family (at least normally, due to the rule above) ->
;;     -> likeliness of having two children is specifiable in the siblings-percentage
;;   - 0-4 have two parents 25-39
;;   - 5-14 have two parents 40-64
;;   - 15-19 have two parents 40-64
;;   - 20-24 may live with another 20-24 (roommates) or with parents 40-64 or alone
;;   - 25-39 may live with another 25-39 or alone
;;   - 40-64 may live with another 40-64 or alone
;;   - >=65 may live with another >=65 or alone
;; Available percentages:
;;   - parents-25-39-percentage -> the percentage of 25-39 being parents (living 
;;     with children)
;;   - parents-40-64-percentage -> the percentage of 40-64 being parents (living 
;;     with children)
;;   - siblings-percentage -> determines the percentage/likeliness of siblings in 
;;     appropriate age classes (applied to those age classes living with parents)
;;   - people-20-24-with-parents-percentage -> the percentage of 20-24 living with 
;;     parents, contains also the siblings (single 20-24 children % will then be 
;;     people-20-24-with-parents-percentage - siblings-percentage)
;;   - people-20-24-house-sharing-percentage -> the percentage of 20-24 living with 
;;     another 20-24 (roommates)
;;   - people-25-39-in-a-couple-percentage -> the percentage of 25-39 living in a couple, 
;;     not necessarily parents, but contains them too (couples without children 
;;     obtainable by subtraction)
;;   - people-40-64-in-a-couple-percentage -> the percentage of 40-64 living in a couple, 
;;     not necessarily parents, but contains them too (couples without children 
;;     obtainable by subtraction)
;;   - people-65-and-over-in-a-couple-percentage -> the percentage of 65 and over living 
;;     in a couple
;; So percentages of people (of a proper age class) living alone are obtainable by 
;; subtraction
;; NB "living in a couple" implies both participants of the couple, the percentage keeps 
;;    track of both
;; NB for these percentages to hold and make sense the % of each age class must be 
;;    coherent with what is written here
;; To check how the families turned out, one can use the following command (or similar 
;; variants):
;; -> ask patches with [ count people-here > 0 ] [ print "-" ask people-here [ print age-class ] ]
;; (prints the age classes of people in families with more than 4 individuals)
